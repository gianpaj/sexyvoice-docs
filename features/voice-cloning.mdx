- **Max file size**: 4.5 MB

## Tips for Best Results

- **Use clear audio** — Minimize background noise and ensure the speaker is easy to hear
- **Single speaker only** — The sample should contain just one person speaking
- **Natural speech** — Conversational speech works better than reading or acting
- **Longer is better** — Samples closer to 5 minutes produce higher quality clones

## Credits

Credits are calculated based on the length of text you generate. Cloned voice generation uses more credits than standard voices.
